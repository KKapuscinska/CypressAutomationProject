## **[My Linkedin Profile :speech_balloon:	](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkapuscinska/)**

Welcome to the "ProjectRSMN" repository! This project aims to create and execute a set of automated tests for the **[Rossmann](https://www.rossmann.pl)** web application. 
The main goal of this project is to improve my proficiency in test automation by utilizing the powerful **Cypress** testing framework. 
It has been developed solely by me, showcasing my skills and expertise in test automation. :trophy:
